# Hey there! 

I'm Manolis, a software developer based in London who's been on quite the journey from hospitality to tech. Currently building [Foundermatcha](https://www.foundermatcha.com/) - helping founders and developers find their perfect match.

## What I'm up to

Right now my role is technically Co-Founder/Lead Developer/CTO at Foundermatcha. Started from zero and we're now at 700+ users, which feels pretty wild. Built the whole thing from scratch and now I'm leading a team of 4 other devs, learning everything on the fly - from basic prototypes to production-ready software that actually makes money.

## My stack

I'm all about **Flutter** and **Dart** these days, but I've got my hands dirty with:

- **Mobile**: Flutter, React Native, Swift, Kotlin
- **Backend**: Java, JavaScript, Python, Spring
- **Cloud**: Firebase (the whole suite), Google Cloud Platform, Vercel, Azure
- **Tools**: Git, CI/CD, Stripe, PostgreSQL, MySQL, RevenueCat, Trello (I'm putting this because I'm so good at making cards and boards) 

## Some stuff I've worked on

**Foundermatcha** (2024-present) - The big one. Took it from idea to 700 users and counting. Matching platform for founders and developers.

**CrewScheduler Pro** (2023-2024) - Built this for the event industry to solve real problems around scheduling, payments, and invoicing. Used by 100+ crew members.

**CrimeSight Analytics** (2022) - Worked with some Psychology and Criminology Professors to design a mobile app prototype for student safety. Crime education, local alerts, safe route planning, and SOS features.

**AI Research at BiteRite** (2023-2024) - Researching transformers and ML to figure out if their holiday planning AI idea was actually possible. It was.

## Background bits

- First-class Computer Science degree from London Met
- Years in hospitality (yeah, really) - taught me work ethic and how to talk to humans
- Muay Thai fighter since 2017 - taught me how to compete and push through the tough stuff

## Random facts

- Grew up in my dad's restaurant
- Used to be college president (way back when)
- Everything I know about tech leadership I learned by doing, not from books

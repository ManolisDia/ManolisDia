# Manos Diamandakis

Software developer in London. Ex-hospitality, now building things with code. Failure is Good.

---

Currently **Co-Founder & Lead Dev at [Foundermatcha](https://www.foundermatcha.com/)** — a platform that matches founders with developers based on vision and values, not just tech stacks. We're at 1500+ users now, which still feels surreal considering I built the first version alone in my flat.

Before this made sense as a career, I spent years in hospitality (grew up in a restaurant). Turns out managing chaotic people is decent prep for managing chaotic codebases.

### What I work with

Mostly **Flutter/Dart**. I've touched the usual suspects — React/ React Native, Swift, Kotlin, Python, Java — but Flutter's where I live now. Clean Architecture enthusiast. Riverpod convert. SOLID Principles are god. Occasional yeller at Xcode.

### Other things I've built

**CrewScheduler Pro** — Scheduling and payments for event crews. Actually makes money, which was a nice surprise.

**CrimeSight** — Crime data viz prototype I built with some university professors. Student safety stuff.

**BiteRite research** — Spent months figuring out if an AI holiday planning idea was technically feasible. It was, but the business wasn't.

### The non-code stuff

- First-class CS degree (London Met)
- Muay Thai since 2017 — good for learning to take hits and keep going
- Former college president, back when I thought that was impressive
